# Business Insights (AI-Generated)

This folder contains **business insights generated by Quadratic AI using natural language prompts**.

The charts and tables stored here are **direct outputs of AI-driven analysis**, produced after Quadratic connected to the PostgreSQL database and executed prompt-based analytical logic.

---

## Purpose of This Folder

The goal of this folder is to demonstrate:
- How AI can generate meaningful supply chain insights from structured data
- How prompt-based analysis translates into business-ready outputs
- What type of questions stakeholders can answer once the data pipeline is automated

These insights represent the **final value layer** of the project.

## How Insights Are Generated

Insights in this folder are produced using the following flow:

1. Quadratic connects directly to the PostgreSQL (Supabase) database
2. Fact and dimension tables are accessed in real time
3. Natural language prompts are issued to Quadratic AI
4. Quadratic generates Python code internally to:
   - Aggregate data
   - Apply KPI logic
   - Generate tables and charts
5. Outputs are reviewed to ensure:
   - Correct supply chain KPI definitions
   - Proper grain handling (order vs order line)
   - Business-safe interpretations

The images in this folder are **screenshots of Quadratic’s AI-generated outputs**.

## AI-Generated Insights Included

### 1. Monthly On-Time Delivery Performance by City

This visualization was generated by Quadratic AI using a prompt similar to:

“Show monthly on-time delivery performance by city.”

The chart highlights:
- Trends in On-Time Delivery % over time
- Performance comparison across cities
- Early indicators of declining or improving reliability

This insight is useful for:
- Operations teams
- Distribution planning
- City-level performance monitoring

---

### 2. Top Customers by Order Value and Reliability

This table was generated by Quadratic AI using a prompt similar to:

“Show top 5 customers based on order value and their OTIF %, In-Full %, and On-Time %.”

The output includes:
- Customer ID and name
- City
- Total order value
- OTIF %, IF %, and OT %

This insight supports:
- Key account management
- SLA discussions
- Customer prioritization and retention strategies

---

## Validation and Interpretation

Although the insights are AI-generated:
- KPI logic was validated against supply chain definitions
- Results were cross-checked with SQL outputs
- Any misleading or incorrect assumptions were corrected

This ensures that AI-generated insights remain **accurate, defensible, and business-relevant**.

---

## Why This Matters

This folder demonstrates how AI can be used as an **analytical copilot**:

- AI accelerates insight generation
- Human expertise ensures correctness
- Together, they enable faster and more reliable decision-making

The insights here showcase the practical business impact of the AI-agentic analytics pipeline.
