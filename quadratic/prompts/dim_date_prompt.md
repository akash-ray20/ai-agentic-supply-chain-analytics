# dim_date Prompt

This prompt was used in Quadratic AI to generate a **date dimension table** required for time-based analysis.

The date dimension enables:
- Monthly trend analysis
- Time-based KPI aggregation
- SLA and performance tracking over time

---

## Prompt Used

Create a date table that has the dates from **03-01-2025 (March 1st, 2025)**  
to **05-31-2025 (May 31st, 2025)**.

---

## Purpose

The `dim_date` table serves as a foundational dimension for:
- Joining order data on dates
- Enabling consistent time intelligence
- Avoiding reliance on raw date fields in fact tables

---

## Notes

- The table was generated using AI-assisted Python code inside Quadratic
- Date ranges were explicitly defined to match the available order data
- Output was reviewed to ensure completeness and correct date sequencing
